# COMPOUND OPERATORS IN JAVA

## 1) WHAT ARE COMPOUND OPERATORS?
Compound operators in Java are shorthand symbols that combine an arithmetic operation with an assignment. Instead of writing two separate steps (performing an operation, then assigning the result), you can do both at once.

The most common compound operators are:
- `+=`
- `-=`
- `*=`
- `/=`
- `%=`

For example, the operator `+=` adds a value to a variable and assigns the new value back to that variable.

## 2) WHY DO WE NEED COMPOUND OPERATORS?
1. **Readability**: They make the code shorter and clearer by reducing repetitive steps.
2. **Convenience**: You don’t have to rewrite the variable name twice.
3. **Consistency**: They follow a common pattern in arithmetic (adding to, subtracting from, etc.), so it’s easy to understand what’s happening.

## 3) HOW DO WE USE COMPOUND OPERATORS?

### Example #1: `+=` (Add and Assign)
    int total = 10;
    // Instead of total = total + 5;
    total += 5; 
    // total is now 15

### Example #2: `-=` (Subtract and Assign)
    int score = 20;
    // Instead of score = score - 3;
    score -= 3; 
    // score is now 17

### Example #3: `*=` (Multiply and Assign)
    int quantity = 4;
    // Instead of quantity = quantity * 5;
    quantity *= 5; 
    // quantity is now 20

### Example #4: `/=` (Divide and Assign)
    int items = 10;
    // Instead of items = items / 2;
    items /= 2; 
    // items is now 5

### Example #5: `%=` (Modulo and Assign)
    int remainder = 14;
    // Instead of remainder = remainder % 5;
    remainder %= 5; 
    // remainder is now 4

## COMMON MISTAKES

### Mistake #1: Mixing Up Data Types
    // Bad Example:
    int total = 10;
    total += 5.5; // Trying to add a decimal to an int can cause issues

    // Better Example:
    double totalValue = 10.0;
    totalValue += 5.5; // Works fine with double

### Mistake #2: Using Compound Operators Without Understanding the Original Operation
    // If you're not familiar with how basic arithmetic works,
    // compound operators can be confusing.

    int value = 8;
    value -= 3;
    // Some might mistakenly think this is value = 3 - value.
    // It's actually value = value - 3, so value is now 5.

### Mistake #3: Division with Integers
    int number = 10;
    number /= 3;
    // number becomes 3, not 3.333..., because we're using int division

    // If you need a decimal result:
    double decimalNumber = 10.0;
    decimalNumber /= 3.0;
    // decimalNumber is approximately 3.3333
